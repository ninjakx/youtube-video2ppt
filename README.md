# youtube-video2ppt

**Note:** For videos more than 15 min of length you might have more than 200 slides in ppt so some Manual deletion might require :( as per your convenience.

This is a command utility to create ppt from the youtube educational video. 
Initally designed for youtube channel: `StatQuest with Josh Starmer` :heart: 
I find his works amazing and I wanted to get the slides out from the video so that I can make a note for revision so I decided to write this script using openCV and shell scripting. 
but now expanded to other usecases to capture the slides from the lecture.

## TO DO:

- [ ] Use Deep Learning based solution to filter out the frames containing only headers.
- [ ] Automate it to create word doc with image and transcribe audio text below the image (will try to introduce text summarizer).
- [ ] Make it to work on black screen teaching method.
- [ ] Using detection model, mask the person to capture only the board and its content to create ppt using Computer Vision.
